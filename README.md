# DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project was for DriverPass, a system to facilitate learning and practice for students to pass their driving tests. They wanted an online system for students to schedule appointments, pick packages, and access learning material. They also wanted each user type(student, driver, admin, DMV) to have their own access for security.

What did you do particularly well?
I think my diagrams, especially my activity diagrams, were very detailed and thorough.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add methods to my class diagram. They weren't required so I didn't do them but it would definitely be what needs the most improvement. I could also elaborate on the attributes as well. My use case diagram is also pretty messy, I should make it easier to read.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I organized the needs specified by Liam for each user type in a use case diagram. I then used the use case diagram to base the other sections off of, making sure I covered all of the requirements. It’s important to consider the user when designing a product to ensure it will be easy to use and not result in frustration from being too complicated or miss some functionality that was expected.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I design software by looking at the requirements, expectations, and limitations. Once a solid foundation involving those is determined, the actual code can be created for the project. Once that base is approved, the ideal system would be scalable and reusable, while also being logical and easy to follow. A technique I would use in the future is creating a UML use case diagram as one of the first things I do, and then I would show that to the customer and make sure nothing is missing.
